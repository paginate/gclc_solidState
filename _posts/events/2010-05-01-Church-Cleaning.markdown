A lot of things need to be repaired and taken care of in our church. 
The work deals with the structure, environment, water pipes, 
lights, weeding, painting, the facade and signs of the church, etc. 
We expect your support, participation, offering and prayers. 
We will start with interior painting on 5/1/2010, 5/8/2010, 5/15/2010 (Saturdays). 
Welcome volunteers to register. 
The registration forms are on the table of the hall.
